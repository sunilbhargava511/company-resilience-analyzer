## Security and Configuration

### Security Measures
- API key stored server-side only (`process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- No client-side API exposure
- Rate limiting via IP detection
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Error message sanitization

### Configuration
- Environment variables:
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Required for Claude API
  - `DEFAULT_MODEL` - Default AI model selection
- Token limits enforced per model
- Extensible configuration system

### Error Handling
- API authentication failures
- Rate limit handling (429 errors)
- Network failures with retry logic
- Invalid response handling
- User-friendly error messages

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Frontend**:
   - Lazy loading of chat interface
   - Debounced input validation
   - Optimized re-renders with React hooks
   - CSS animations using GPU acceleration

2. **Backend**:
   - Streaming responses (potential enhancement)
   - Caching possibilities for repeated queries
   - Token optimization in prompts

3. **UX Enhancements**:

3. Add real-time financial data APIs
4. Enhanced PDF processing
5. Export to multiple formats (PDF, DOCX)
6. Batch company analysis
7. Comparison tools for multiple companies
8. API rate limit management with queuing

### Feature Additions

- Concurrent user handling
- Response caching strategies
- Database requirements for scale

## Conclusion

The Company Resilience Analyzer is a sophisticated application that leverages AI to provide comprehensive business analysis. While it currently relies on Claude's knowledge and web search rather than direct financial data feeds, it offers a powerful framework for evaluating companies through the lens of complexity investing. The modular architecture and clean code structure make it well-positioned for future enhancements and integrations.
